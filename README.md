# Kata-Go

## Purpose
I'm looking to practice TDD with Golang and wanted to do it publically. This way I can share my code with colleagues and friends, get feedback, and write better code.

My intention is to make excessively small commits so the history can be replayed alongside verbose messages that contain my thinking. My hope is to show my thought processes both so that I can "pair" with myself (rubby ducky coding) and so that anyone who looks at the code can understand.

This is as much about the language as it is about the discipline of TDD. Trying to drill the techniques until they become habit.

## Practice

I will be religiously following a TDD cycle. Writing the minimum test code to have a failing test, making it pass, cleaning up code if I see value in it. I'll be explaining my decisions as much as possible in messages.

I'll be tackling common kata problems in individual modules, trying to focus on built in Go tools as much as possible.
